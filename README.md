## scATAC- and scRNA-seq data preprocessing scripts
> *by Anna Chechenina, summer 2023*

In this repo you can find some draft script for scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq preprocessing using R and Python. I used public 10X-Genomics datasets most of the time and tried different approaches for data filtering and normalisation. 
These scripts are not complete, so please, contact me if you have any questions or comments.
